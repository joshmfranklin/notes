# Firing up Jekyll #
## Steps to setting up a post in Jekyll ##

As promised I will be continuing to post my progress using Jekyll and other new development learnings I have gleaned since diving into this new realm of design/development.

It has been about a week since posting my first note to my new Jekyll based blog and I thought I would walk through the steps needed to push a new post. Thanks to [Brett Chalupa](brettchalupa.com) for the assist!

Steps to firing up a new post in Jekyll\

* Start up terminal or another third party application such as iTerm\
* Once you are in the terminal cd into your Jekyll blog file with `cd blog`
    + After you have changed to your blog directory you will also be in gh-pages (GitHub Pages)
* Next start up a local Jekyll server by using `jekyll -w`
