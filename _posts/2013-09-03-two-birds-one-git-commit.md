So I told my good friend [Brett Chalupa](http://brettchalupa.com) that I wanted to learn Git. He suggested that I learn git and document my learning at the same time. By utilizing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) I could kill two birds with one stone!

As of September 13th I will be moving from Burlington, Vermont to New York City to begin a new career in UI/UX Design at [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com). I want to utilize this new platform to document my learnings, questions, grumblings, and excitement. My hope is that by documenting my process it will help me learn faster and become a more envolved member of the online design/development community. 

Keep a lookout for more posts coming soon!
